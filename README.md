What Is Scikit-Learn?

Scikit-learn is an open-sourced Python library and includes a variety of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. It is based on technologies and libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas and NumPy and helps simplify the coding task.

Scikit-learn features include:

Model selection
Classification (K-Nearest Neighbors inclusive)
Preprocessing (Min-Max Normalization inclusive)
Clustering (K-Means++ and K-Means inclusive)
Regression (Logistic and Linear Regression inclusive)
To understand Scikit-learn better, let us discuss some of the uses, pros and cons of Scikit-learn.

Use of Scikit-Learn

Scikit-learn allows us to define machine learning algorithms and compare them to one another, as well as offers tools to preprocess data. K-means clustering, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and any other machine learning model that we might want to develop are all included in Scikit-learn.

Scikit-learn’s true strength resides in its model assessment and selection architecture, which allows us to cross-validate and perform multiple hyperparameter searches on our models. Scikit-learn also helps us choose the best model for our work.

Let us now look at some pros and cons of using Scikit-learn.

Pros

Users who want to connect the algorithms to their platforms will find detailed API documentation on the scikit-learn website.
Many contributors, authors, and a large international online community support and update Scikit-learn.
It's simple to use.
The library is released under the BSD license, making it available for free with only the most basic licensing and legal constraints.
The scikit-learn package is extremely adaptable and useful, and it can be used for a variety of real-world tasks such as developing neuroimages, predicting consumer behavior, and so on.
Cons

Not a great choice if one prefers in-depth learning.
Provides a simple abstraction that may tempt junior data scientists to proceed without first learning the basics.
What Is TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is a Google-maintained open-source framework for prototyping and assessing machine learning models, primarily neural networks. TensorFlow is written in a variety of languages, including Swift, Python, Go, Javascript, Java, and C++, and includes community-built support for a variety of others. 

TensorFlow organizes low-level numerical programming in a high-level and abstract manner. It also supports libraries that allow our applications to run on a standard CPU without modification. Linux, Android, macOS, and Windows are among TensorFlow’s supported systems. The Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine can also run TensorFlow models without the use of a traditional computing platform.

Now that we understand TensorFlow a little better, let us now dive into some of its uses, and the pros and cons of using TensorFlow.
