**_What Is Scikit-Learn?_**

Scikit-learn is an open-sourced Python library and includes a variety of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. It is based on technologies and libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas and NumPy and helps simplify the coding task.

_Scikit-learn features include:_
1) Model selection
2) Classification (K-Nearest Neighbors inclusive)
3) Preprocessing (Min-Max Normalization inclusive)
4) Clustering (K-Means++ and K-Means inclusive)
5) Regression (Logistic and Linear Regression inclusive)

_Use of Scikit-Learn_
Scikit-learn allows us to define machine learning algorithms and compare them to one another, as well as offers tools to preprocess data. K-means clustering, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and any other machine learning model that we might want to develop are all included in Scikit-learn.
Scikit-learn’s true strength resides in its model assessment and selection architecture, which allows us to cross-validate and perform multiple hyperparameter searches on our models. Scikit-learn also helps us choose the best model for our work.

_Pros_
1) Users who want to connect the algorithms to their platforms will find detailed API documentation on the scikit-learn website.
2) Many contributors, authors, and a large international online community support and update Scikit-learn.
3) It's simple to use. The library is released under the BSD license, making it available for free with only the most basic licensing and legal          constraints.
4) The scikit-learn package is extremely adaptable and useful, and it can be used for a variety of real-world tasks such as developing neuroimages, predicting consumer behavior, and so on.

_Cons_
1) nNot a great choice if one prefers in-depth learning.
2) Provides a simple abstraction that may tempt junior data scientists to proceed without first learning the basics.

**_What Is TensorFlow?_**

TensorFlow is a Google-maintained open-source framework for prototyping and assessing machine learning models, primarily neural networks. TensorFlow is written in a variety of languages, including Swift, Python, Go, Javascript, Java, and C++, and includes community-built support for a variety of others. 
TensorFlow organizes low-level numerical programming in a high-level and abstract manner. It also supports libraries that allow our applications to run on a standard CPU without modification. Linux, Android, macOS, and Windows are among TensorFlow’s supported systems. The Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine can also run TensorFlow models without the use of a traditional computing platform.

_Use of TensorFlow_
Although TensorFlow is generally linked with neural networks, it is well-tuned for any of the machine learning methods that employ gradients in general (such as Boosted Trees). TensorFlow also offers TensorBoard, a visualization tool for comparing and tracking our learned models.
TensorFlow's attractiveness stems from its speed and neural network optimization. Very few frameworks can match TensorFlow's ability to run models on GPUs, CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.

_Pros_
1) It can quickly and easily calculate mathematical expressions.
2) TensorFlow can generate numerous sequence models and train a deep neural network for handwritten digit classification.
3) TensorFlow offers a unique feature that allows it to improve memory and data usage at the same time.
4) It has Google's support. It provides regular new feature releases, quick upgrades, and smooth performance.
5) TensorFlow is built to work with a variety of backend software (ASICs, GPUs, and so on) and to be extremely parallel.
6) TensorFlow has a strong community behind it.

_Cons_
1) When compared to its competitors, TensorFlow falls short on both usability and speed.
2) It is an entry-level game with a high learning curve.
3) OpenCL is not supported.
4) Because of TensorFlow’s unique structure, it is tough to discover and troubleshoot errors.
5) TensorFlow lags in the area of computational speed because we focus on the production environment rather than performance.
