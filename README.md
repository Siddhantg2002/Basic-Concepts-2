**_What Is TensorFlow?_**

TensorFlow is a Google-maintained open-source framework for prototyping and assessing machine learning models, primarily neural networks. TensorFlow is written in a variety of languages, including Swift, Python, Go, Javascript, Java, and C++, and includes community-built support for a variety of others. 
TensorFlow organizes low-level numerical programming in a high-level and abstract manner. It also supports libraries that allow our applications to run on a standard CPU without modification. Linux, Android, macOS, and Windows are among TensorFlow’s supported systems. The Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine can also run TensorFlow models without the use of a traditional computing platform.

_Use of TensorFlow_

Although TensorFlow is generally linked with neural networks, it is well-tuned for any of the machine learning methods that employ gradients in general (such as Boosted Trees). TensorFlow also offers TensorBoard, a visualization tool for comparing and tracking our learned models.
TensorFlow's attractiveness stems from its speed and neural network optimization. Very few frameworks can match TensorFlow's ability to run models on GPUs, CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.

_Pros_
1) It can quickly and easily calculate mathematical expressions.
2) TensorFlow can generate numerous sequence models and train a deep neural network for handwritten digit classification.
3) TensorFlow offers a unique feature that allows it to improve memory and data usage at the same time.
4) It has Google's support. It provides regular new feature releases, quick upgrades, and smooth performance.
5) TensorFlow is built to work with a variety of backend software (ASICs, GPUs, and so on) and to be extremely parallel.
6) TensorFlow has a strong community behind it.

_Cons_
1) When compared to its competitors, TensorFlow falls short on both usability and speed.
2) It is an entry-level game with a high learning curve.
3) OpenCL is not supported.
4) Because of TensorFlow’s unique structure, it is tough to discover and troubleshoot errors.
5) TensorFlow lags in the area of computational speed because we focus on the production environment rather than performance.
